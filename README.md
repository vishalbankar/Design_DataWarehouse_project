## ðŸš€ Project Requirements
Building the Data Warehouse (Data Engineering)

#### Objective

Develop a modern data warehouse using SQL Server to consolidate sales data, enabling analytical reporting and informed decision-making.

Specifications
1) Data Sources: Import data from two source systems (ERP and CRM) provided as CSV files.  
2) Data Quality: Cleanse and resolve data quality issues prior to analysis.  
3) Integration: Combine both sources into a single, user-friendly data model designed for analytical queries.  
4) Scope: Focus on the latest dataset only; historization of data is not required.  
5) Documentation: Provide clear documentation of the data model to support both business stakeholders and analytics teams.


## BI: Analytics & Reporting (Data Analysis)
#### Objective 
Develop SQL-based analytics to deliver detailed insights into:

- Customer Behavior
- Product Performance
- Sales Trends
- Power BI report (pending)
  
These insights empower stakeholders with key business metrics, enabling strategic decision-making.
